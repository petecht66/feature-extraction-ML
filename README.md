Date Assigned: September 18, 2025
Date Submitted: September 28, 2025

This project was an assignment for CISC484: Intro to Machine Learning, which is being taught in the Fall of 2025 at the University of Delaware by Professor Xu Yuan. This class is an undergraduate course within the Computer and Information Sciences department at the University of Delaware College of Engineering. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the key concepts and techniques of machine learning.

This specific project deals with feature extraction for posts on Twitter, which is now known as X. The goal with this process is to identify certain features that help us predict which tweets/posts are spam and which are not. 

Professor Yuan provided some starter folders and code for students to begin with. The file of interest within this repository is the 'Twitter.py' file within the 'tool' folder. Both the 'User' and 'Tweet' classes contain several functions that identify certain features about a Twitter/X account or a tweet/post.

To modify this code and project, Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook were accessed through Anaconda Navigator. After submission, this project was uploaded to GitHub.
